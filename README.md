# AWS RDS Challenge Lab: Database Server Setup & Interaction

This repository showcases my work on the **AWS Challenge Lab: Build Your DB Server and Interact with Your DB**. In this lab, I configured an Amazon RDS instance with MySQL, created and managed tables, inserted sample data, and performed queries using AWS tools.

## Lab Summary

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) simplifies the process of setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud. This lab reinforces the use of an AWS-managed database instance, which provides scalability, security, and convenience for managing relational data.

## Objectives

By completing this lab, I accomplished the following:

- **Created an Amazon RDS instance** with MySQL.
- **Set up database tables** (`RESTART` and `CLOUD_PRACTITIONER`) and populated them with sample data.
- **Queried the database** using the Amazon RDS Query Editor and MySQL client.
- **Performed an inner join** to retrieve consolidated data from both tables.

## Repository Structure

- **screenshots/**: Contains images demonstrating each step.
  - `create_table_RESTART.png`: Creation of the `RESTART` table.
  - `insert_RESTART_sample_rows.png`: Sample data insertion into `RESTART`.
  - `select_RESTART_table.png`: Verification of data in `RESTART`.
  - `create_table_CLOUD_PRACTITIONER.png`: Creation of `CLOUD_PRACTITIONER`.
  - `insert_CLOUD_PRACTITIONER_sample_rows.png`: Sample data insertion into `CLOUD_PRACTITIONER`.
  - `select_CLOUD_PRACTITIONER_table.png`: Verification of data in `CLOUD_PRACTITIONER`.
  - `inner_join_tables.png`: Results of an inner join between `RESTART` and `CLOUD_PRACTITIONER`.

## Key Learnings

Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **Launching and managing an RDS instance** in AWS.
- **Setting up and interacting** with relational databases in a cloud environment.
- **Using SQL for data manipulation and retrieval** in a structured, cloud-hosted database.
